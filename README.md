# Competitive Programming Language
This language is designed specifically for competitive programming. Its goal is to be as short and concise as possible. While many programming languages prioritize readability and maintainability for large, long-term projects, that is not the focus here. Competitive programmers typically write and submit solutions within a few hours, so long-term maintainability is unnecessary — speed of writing matters more.

The standard library is built with performance in mind, without handling uncommon edge cases that never appear in contests. Due to the fast-evolving nature of this language and its niche purpose, backward compatibility is not guaranteed.
